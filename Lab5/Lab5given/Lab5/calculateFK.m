% INPUT:
%   q - 1x6 vector of joint inputs [q1,q2,q3,q4,q5,lg]
%
% OUTPUT:
%   jointPositions - 6 x 3 matrix, where each row represents one 
%                    joint along the robot. Each row contains the [x,y,z]
%                    coordinates of the respective joint's center (mm). For
%                    consistency, the first joint should be located at 
%                    [0,0,0]. These values are used to plot the robot.
%   T0i            - a 4 x 4 x 6 list of homogeneous transformation matrix, 
%                    representing each joint frame expressed in the 
%                    base (0) frame. :,:,i is T0i
