% ASTAR Find the shortest path from start to goal.
%   PATH = ASTAR(map, start, goal) returns an mx6 matrix, where each row
%   consists of the configuration of the Lynx at a point on the path. The
%   first row is start and the last row is goal. If no path is found, PATH
%   is a 0x6 matrix. Consecutive points in PATH should not be farther apart
%   than neighboring voxels in the map (e.g. if 5 consecutive points in
%   PATH are co-linear, don't simplify PATH by removing the 3 intermediate points).
%
% INPUTS:
