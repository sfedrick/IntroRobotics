% INPUT:
%   q - 1x6 vector of joint inputs [q1,q2,q3,q4,q5,lg]
%
% OUTPUT:
%   jointPositions - 6 x 3 matrix, where each row represents one 
%                    joint along the robot. Each row contains the [x,y,z]
%                    coordinates of the respective joint's center (mm). For
%                    consistency, the first joint should be located at 
%                    [0,0,0]. These values are used to plot the robot.
%   T0e            - a 4 x 4 homogeneous transformation matrix, 
%                    representing the end effector frame expressed in the 
%                    base (0) frame
%   numRunsEnd     - a counter of how many times this function was called.
%                    Used in the autograder to detect use of the solution
%                    code in the students' submissions.
